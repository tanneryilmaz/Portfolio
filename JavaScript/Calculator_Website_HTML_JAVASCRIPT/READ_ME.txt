This website is designed to be used for solving physics problems. When doing physics homework, oftentimes there are many values that need to be kept track of. This calculator allows for values to be saved to the screen along with a label for each value. After making a calculation using this calculator, the user should press the 'S' button on the calculator. A prompt will appear asking the user to enter a label for the value which they have calculated. After entering a label, the value will be written to the screen along with its label.
