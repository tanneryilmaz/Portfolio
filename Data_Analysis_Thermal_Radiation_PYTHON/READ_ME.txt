All of the data analyzed in the jupyter notebook files was collected in one of Tulane University's physics laboratories. 

The fourth order temperature dependence of the intensity of thermal radiation (Stefan-Boltzmann law) was established 
by using log-log regression. The inverse square relationship between distance and radiation intensity was established as
well. 

All equations used in the jupyter notebook file can be found in the data analysis primer document in this repository. 
The data analysis primer document was not prepared by me.
